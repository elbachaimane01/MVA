## About

In this repository, you will find the list of courses I undertook, along with brief descriptions of each course's content. The courses provided me with a solid foundation in various key areas of DL ML and AI.

## Courses

1. **ALTEGRAD** - Advanced Learning Techniques for Text and Graph Data
   - Description: This course (28 hours) aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ML and AI methods for text and graph data, with a significant focus on applications. Each session comprises two hours of lecture followed by two hours of programming sessions. For more information, you can visit the course page [here](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/cat-advanced-learning-for-text-and-graph-data-altegrad/).

2. **Computational Statistics**
   - Description: This course details statistical computational methods and Bayesian inference. It starts with the stochastic gradient algorithm, its theoretical properties, and numerical bottlenecks. After introducing Bayesian inference, the course discusses numerical challenges when computing Bayesian estimators, leading to the EM algorithm and its stochastic versions, as well as Majorize – Minimize algorithms. Stochastic approximations are also covered to understand the convergence conditions of the previous algorithms. The second part of the course focuses on random variable simulation methods, including the rejection method, classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers (Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs algorithms), and recent advances in MCMC such as Adaptive MCMC, adaptive parallel tempering, and Approximated Bayesian Computing methods.

3. **Convex Optimization**
   - Description: The objective of this course is to learn how to recognize, manipulate, and solve a relatively wide class of emerging convex problems in fields such as machine learning, finance, and signal processing. The course covers topics including convex modeling, sets, functions, and programs; reminders of convex analysis; duality; algorithms such as interior point methods, constraints, barriers, self-concordance, complexity, and first-order methods with acceleration. Applications in statistics, machine learning, finance, signal processing, combinatorics, and convex relaxations are explored. For more information, you can visit the course page [here](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/convex-optimization-and-applications-in-machine-learning/).

4. **Numerical Imaging**
   - Description: The first objective of this course is to familiarize students with digital images, including principles of image formation and acquisition (sensors, sampling, quantification, dynamics, noise), key elements of image structure (radiometry, color, geometry, texture, acquisition artifacts), and classical tools for image enhancement and analysis. The second objective is to apply various advanced mathematical tools taught elsewhere in the master (Wavelets, PDE, variational approaches, stochastic approaches, etc.) in a thematic approach. The course is illustrated with examples from domains such as consumer digital photography, medical imaging, and aerial imaging.

5. **RecVis22 (Object Recognition and Computer Vision)**
   - Description: This course introduces the models, methods, and algorithms used in automated object recognition and scene analysis from photographs and videos. Topics covered include instance-level recognition (camera geometry, local-invariant features, correspondence, efficient visual search), category-level recognition (bags of features, sparse coding, and dictionary learning), neural networks and optimization methods, convolutional neural networks for visual recognition, motion and human actions, 3D object recognition, and weakly-supervised learning for visual recognition.

6. **Traitement de Signal** (Signal Processing and Deep Learning: Introduction and Industrial Applications)
   - Description: This module aims to understand the contributions of deep learning approaches to signal processing problems through various industrial use cases, such as radar emitter identification, signal detection for cognitive radio, speaker recognition, reconstruction of altered audio signals, and predictive maintenance. The course will cover "classical" signal processing treatments and revisit them with a deep learning approach for each use case. The theoretical part of the course will introduce signal processing concepts (time-frequency and time-scale representations, filtering) and machine learning concepts (supervised and unsupervised approaches, classification and data partitioning algorithms, optimization, gradient descent, basics of deep learning, and major neural network architectures). The course will strive to answer the question "what makes deep learning truly deep?" by alternating between theory and practice. It will also discuss research organization in industry.

7. **Generative Models for Images**
   - Description: The goal of this course is to give an overview of existing methods for generative modeling with applications to images. The first part of the course focuses on modern image models such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Normalizing Flows (NFs). It discusses applications of these models for conditional image generation. The rest of the course is dedicated to the study of a new contender in generative modeling called diffusion models or Score-Based Generative Models (SGM). It explores the mathematical aspects (Time reversal of stochastic processes, links with Regularized Optimal Transport, and control) and practical aspects of these algorithms, including practical implementations like DDIM (Denoising Implicit Diffusion Models), LDM (Latent Diffusion Models), and their application to inverse problems and text-to-image synthesis through the lens of StableDiffusion.

8. **Graph Models**
   - Description: Graphical models provide a powerful paradigm to jointly exploit probability theory and graph theory for solving complex real-world problems. This course focuses on discrete models, where the random variables of the graphical models are discrete. It begins with an introduction to the basics of graphical models, then covers problems in representation, inference, and learning of graphical models. Classical and state-of-the-art algorithms used for these problems are studied, along with several applications in machine learning and computer vision.

9. **Machine Learning for Geoscience**
   - Description: This course is an introduction to statistical learning techniques applied to geosciences, with applications in the energy domain. Geophysical measurements are acquired using high-tech sensors under extreme conditions. These measurements describe and analyze the subsurface to make critical decisions. They come in different types—images, signals—and are based on a wide variety of physics (electromagnetic, ultrasonic, mechanical, etc.). This course illustrates examples of automated tasks with artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical learning and covers the entire data processing chain, from acquisition to interpretation. The course includes both theoretical and practical content on traditional methods, conventional statistical learning methods, and deep learning methods. It emphasizes how these techniques have been adapted to the specificity of geoscience measurements and industrial constraints, including model size reduction to meet hardware constraints, acceleration of annotation procedures with augmentation strategies, noisy annotations, capitalization on physical models, knowledge transfer, domain adaptation, among others. Several applications and datasets will be provided (geology, corrosion, geo-energy).

10. **Algorithms for Speech and Natural Language Processing**
   - Description: Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications. This course presents the full stack of speech and language technology, from automatic speech recognition to parsing and semantic processing. Each level covers the key principles, algorithms, and mathematical principles behind the state of the art and compares them with human speech and language processing knowledge. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of the scientific issues and computational techniques in automatic speech and language processing and will have hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating important algorithms. Topics covered include speech features and signal processing, hidden Markov and finite state modeling, probabilistic parsing, continuous embeddings, deep learning for language-related tasks (DNNs, RNNs), linguistics and psycholinguistics, and comparing human and machine performance.
