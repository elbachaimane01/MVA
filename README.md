# MVA: mathematics vision and learning - Portfolio

  Welcome to my GitHub page presenting the coursework completed during my Masters MVA. This repository contains a comprehensive overview of the subjects I explored, the skills I developed, and the practical applications I engaged in throughout my academic journey.

## About

In this repository, you will find the list of courses I undertook, along with brief descriptions of each course's content. The courses provided me with a solid foundation in various key areas of DL ML and AI.

## Courses

1. **ALTEGRAD** - Advanced Learning Techniques for Text and Graph Data
   - Description: This course (28 hours) aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art ML and AI methods for text and graph data, with a significant focus on applications. Each session comprises two hours of lecture followed by two hours of programming sessions. For more information, you can visit the course page [here](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/cat-advanced-learning-for-text-and-graph-data-altegrad/).

2. **Computational Statistics**
   - Description: This course details statistical computational methods and Bayesian inference. It starts with the stochastic gradient algorithm, its theoretical properties, and numerical bottlenecks. After introducing Bayesian inference, the course discusses numerical challenges when computing Bayesian estimators, leading to the EM algorithm and its stochastic versions, as well as Majorize â€“ Minimize algorithms. Stochastic approximations are also covered to understand the convergence conditions of the previous algorithms. The second part of the course focuses on random variable simulation methods, including the rejection method, classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers (Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs algorithms), and recent advances in MCMC such as Adaptive MCMC, adaptive parallel tempering, and Approximated Bayesian Computing methods. For more information, you can visit the course page [here](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/computational-statistics/).

3. **Convex Optimization**
   - Description: The objective of this course is to learn how to recognize, manipulate, and solve a relatively wide class of emerging convex problems in fields such as machine learning, finance, and signal processing. The course covers topics including convex modeling, sets, functions, and programs; reminders of convex analysis; duality; algorithms such as interior point methods, constraints, barriers, self-concordance, complexity, and first-order methods with acceleration. Applications in statistics, machine learning, finance, signal processing, combinatorics, and convex relaxations are explored. For more information, you can visit the course page [here](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/convex-optimization-and-applications-in-machine-learning/).

4. **Numerical Imaging**
   - Description: The first objective of this course is to familiarize students with digital images, including principles of image formation and acquisition (sensors, sampling, quantification, dynamics, noise), key elements of image structure (radiometry, color, geometry, texture, acquisition artifacts), and classical tools for image enhancement and analysis. The second objective is to apply various advanced mathematical tools taught elsewhere in the master (Wavelets, PDE, variational approaches, stochastic approaches, etc.) in a thematic approach. The course is illustrated with examples from domains such as consumer digital photography, medical imaging, and aerial imaging.

5. **RecVis22 (Object Recognition and Computer Vision)**
   - Description: This course introduces the models, methods, and algorithms used in automated object recognition and scene analysis from photographs and videos. Topics covered include instance-level recognition (camera geometry, local-invariant features, correspondence, efficient visual search), category-level recognition (bags of features, sparse coding, and dictionary learning), neural networks and optimization methods, convolutional neural networks for visual recognition, motion and human actions, 3D object recognition, and weakly-supervised learning for visual recognition.
